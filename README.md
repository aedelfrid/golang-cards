# Cards

Adapted from the Udemy GoLang masterclass first project.

This project will take the skills learned in the first unit as well as my previous experience in
development to become a full featured card game.

I will use https://ebitengine.org/ for the engine once I am ready to move the game from the
command line.

## Stage one

Early in the dev cycle i think its important to figure out the big hurdles that will come with 
more advanced features. To this end i will implement Texas Hold'em as my first game.

### Texas Hold'em

this game will have all the features that will be necessary for later games, i believe.

For example;
    Player hands
    Dealer hands/community cards
    turns-taking
    chips/betting

## Stage two

i'm just kinda excitied to get some hands on experience with an actual game engine. i am
looking into learning C# at some point but its not my number one priority. SO ill get my
game dev itch scratched with GO.

### https://ebitengine.org/

ebitengine is apparently really simple which should be a fun first dip into actually working with
an engine.
